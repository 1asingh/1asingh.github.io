## ECDF
Python code block for ECDF:
```python
    import numpy as np

    def ecdf(df,col_name):  
      # col_name (str): name of the column in dataframe df 
      x = np.sort(df[col_name])
      y = np.arange(1, len(x)+1) / len(x)
      return x,y
```
Computing percentiles `np.percentile(df['col_name'], [25, 50, 75])`.

## Poisson Process
* The timing of the next event is completely independent of when the previous event happened
* Examples of Poisson processes:
  1. Natural births in a given hospital
  2. Hit on a website during a given hour
  3. Meteor strikes
  4. Molecular collisions in a gas
  5. Aviation incidents
  
Mathematically: The number $$r$$ of arrivals of a Poisson process in a given time interval with average rate of $$Î»$$ arrivals
per interval is Poisson distributed.
Example: The number $$r$$ of hits on a website in one hour with an average hit rate of 6 hits per hour is Poisson distributed.
Poisson distributed: `np.random.poisson(6, size=10000) `

## Bootstrap confidence interval
* In statistical inference, you want to know what would happen if you could repeat your data acquisition an infinite number of times. The technique to do it is aptly called bootstrapping.
Python code block for Bootstrapping:
```python
      def bootstrap_replicate_1d(data, func):
        """Generate bootstrap replicate of 1D data."""
        # Bootstrap sample(bs_sample ): a resampled array of the data
        bs_sample = np.random.choice(data, len(data)) 
        # Bootstrap sample(func(bs_sample) ): statistic computed from a resampled array
        return func(bs_sample)
```
```python  
    def draw_bs_reps(data, func, size=1):
        """ This function Generates many bootstrap replicates """

        # Initialize array of replicates: bs_replicates
        bs_replicates = np.empty(size)

        # Generate replicates:Draw bootstrap replicates.
        for i in range(size):
            bs_replicates[i] = bootstrap_replicate_1d(data, func)
        return bs_replicates  
```

+ Confidence interval of a statistic: If we repeated measurements over and over again, $$p%$$ of the observed values would lie within the $$p%$$ confidence interval.
- Example:
   1. Take 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean:  `bs_replicates = draw_bs_reps(rainfall,np.mean,10000)`.
   2. Bootstrap confidence interval: `conf_int = np.percentile(bs_replicates, [2.5, 97.5])`.

### Pairs bootstrap:
* For Linear regression:
  1. Resample data in pairs
  2. Compute slope and intercept from resampled data
  3. Each slope and intercept is a bootstrap replicate
  4. Compute confidence intervals from percentiles of bootstrap
 
 Python code block for Pairs bootstrap in linear regression:
```python
    def draw_bs_pairs_linreg(x, y, size=1):
    """Perform pairs bootstrap for linear regression."""

    # Set up array of indices to sample from: inds
    inds = np.arange(len(x))

    # Initialize replicates: bs_slope_reps, bs_intercept_reps
    bs_slope_reps = np.empty(size)
    bs_intercept_reps = np.empty(size)

    # Generate replicates
    for i in range(size):
        bs_inds = np.random.choice(inds, size=len(inds))
        bs_x, bs_y = x[bs_inds], y[bs_inds]
        bs_slope_reps[i], bs_intercept_reps[i] = np.polyfit(bs_x, bs_y,1)

    return bs_slope_reps, bs_intercept_reps
```

## Bootstrap hypothesis testing
   * Hypothesis testing: Assessment of how reasonable the observed data are assuming a hypothesis is true
   * Null hypothesis: name for the hypothesis you are testing
