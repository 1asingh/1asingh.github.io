## ECDF
Python code block for ECDF:
```python
    import numpy as np

    def ecdf(df,col_name):  
      # col_name (str): name of the column in dataframe df 
      x = np.sort(df[col_name])
      y = np.arange(1, len(x)+1) / len(x)
      return x,y
```
Computing percentiles `np.percentile(df['col_name'], [25, 50, 75])`.

## Poisson Process
* The timing of the next event is completely independent of when the previous event happened
* Examples of Poisson processes:
  1. Natural births in a given hospital
  2. Hit on a website during a given hour
  3. Meteor strikes
  4. Molecular collisions in a gas
  5. Aviation incidents
  
Mathematically: The number $$r$$ of arrivals of a Poisson process in a given time interval with average rate of $$Î»$$ arrivals
per interval is Poisson distributed.
Example: The number $$r$$ of hits on a website in one hour with an average hit rate of 6 hits per hour is Poisson distributed.
Poisson distributed: `np.random.poisson(6, size=10000) `
